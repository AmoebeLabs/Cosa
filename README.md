Cosa
====

Object-oriented platform for Arduino. Class hierarchy for Pins, Watchdog and SPI. Supports device drivers for additional hardware abstraction and event driven programming for low power.

To install download and move the Cosa directory to the Arduino cores directory within arduino itself, i.e., your-arduino-install-directory/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino.

The examples should be moved to your sketchbook directory. 

Cosa classes are included with:

#include "Cosa/FileName.h"
