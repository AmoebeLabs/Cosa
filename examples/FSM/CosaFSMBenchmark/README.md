CosaFSMBenchmark
================

The classical finite state machine benchmark with measurement of event
send time. The machine has only one state and for each received event
sends an event to a connected machine. 

The measurement contains the pushing of the event onto the event
queue, pulling and dispatch of the event to the receiving state
machine.  

Circuit

This example requires no special circuit.
