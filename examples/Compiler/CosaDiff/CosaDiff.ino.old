 * @section Description
 * Testing code generation of arithmetric and comparison of unsigned 
 * numbers. Force wrap-around uint32_t and show how this workds.
 *
 * The conclusion is that difference should be signed and comparison
 * operators should be avoided. Instead compare with difference to 
 * handle wrap-around and negative interval correctly.

 *   int32_t diff = t1 - t0;

 *   bool correct = diff < 0;
