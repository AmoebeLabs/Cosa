Demonstration of Cosa OneWire DS18B20 1-Wire driver. Three Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometers are used. See Bench and Screenshot.

Circuit

The Arduino Pin 7 is used as the 1-wire bus. Use a pullup resistor (4-5 Kohm) to power (Vcc). Connect Vcc and ground to the Digital Thermometer. The example code assumes three devices but this is not critical. 

See Bench.jpg for a picture of a typical circuit using three devices, a pull-up resistor and an Arduino Nano with an IO shield.
