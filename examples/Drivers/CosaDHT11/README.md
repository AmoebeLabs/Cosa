Demonstration of Cosa DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor device driver. Sample and print values.

Circuit

For this example you need a DHT11 sensor/module. There are modules available with both power LED and pullup resistor. 

Connect Arduino Pin 7 to DHT11 data pin. Connect power (Vcc) and ground.

See Bench.jpg for an example of connection with a DHT11 module from an Arduino Nano and a Nano IO shield.
