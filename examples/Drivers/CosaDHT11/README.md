CosaDHT11
=========

Demonstration of Cosa DHT11/DHT22 Humidity & Temperature Sensor device
driver. Sample and print values. 

Circuit
-------
For this example you need a DHT11 and a DHT22 sensor/module. There are
modules available with both power LED and pullup resistor. Connect
Arduino Pin 7 to DHT11 data pin and Pin 8 to DHT22 data pin. Connect
power (VCC) and ground.

The Arduino Pin 13 (builtin LED) is on during the temperature and
humidity sampling.
