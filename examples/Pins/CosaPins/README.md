Demonstration of Cosa Pin abstraction. Sketch pin usage is declarative and object-oriented. 

Circuit

Pin 2 should be connected to a button/switch with pullup resistor. 
Pin 7 should also be connected to a button/switch. 
Pin 14 (Analog 0) should be connected to a potentmeter so that the voltage may vary between Vcc and ground.
